    <h2>I dont know how to write a love letter or have good handwriting so your getting a ramble i would like to srat off by saying
    im so confused just in general i dont know what i want to do in life and many people tell me differnt things "your smart go to college"
    or "tech is perfect for you" im so lost in my emotions to i get constant mood swings from happy to sad then jelious then depressed then
    mad for being depressed i literaly am fighting a battle each day just to "be alright" and i still cant focus of the present in life
    but i dont have that issue when im with you whenever we are spending time together nothing else matters but me and you which is 
    also why i get a bit jelious when your friends steal you from me i really dont mean to be dramatic but like i almost need you 
    when i dont see you its a bad day when i have to like idk but i just care about you so much and i dont know how to process that
    i also am teriffied that i care about you that much becuase i dont think you wnat to stay with me and i cant deal with that reality
    its fucking paralizying to think about your the person i care about the most like ever i dont give a fuck about my friends when your around
    i just love you so muxh its scary Honestly it feels like you don’t feel the same as me which I know isn’t true and your just bad at showing 
    it but I just like idk I can’t deal with the thought of a breakup cause I literally only care about you i just like love you so much i know
    you say "dont think about that" its sometimes the only though on my mind i just cant imgine living without you and i want you to know that 
    you dont really want to do long distance but ill do anything to make it work anyways probubly none of this makes sense but i love you so much </h2>
